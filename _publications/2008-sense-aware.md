title: "Interpreting Pre-trained Word Embeddings using Parts of Speech Metarepresentations"
collection: publications
permalink: /files/thesis_file.pdf
excerpt: 'This graduate thesis encompasses the creation of Parts of Speech Metarepresentations via projection, which acts as a steering vector for the pre-trained word embeddings. As these metarepresentations are very small compared to the original word embeddings, interpreting them in terms of parts of speech becomes easier. It was also statistically verified that the addition of these metarepresentations to the original word embeddings was able to improve their performance on various downstream tasks.'
