excerpt: 'This research focuses on building dynamic metarepresentations of word vectors. This research is an extension of the work - Syntactic Representations Enable Interpretable Hierarchical Vectors. This work aims to resolve the previous limitation of Polysemy by generating metarepresentations which can better capture the parts of speech dimensions as given by the context of the word.'
