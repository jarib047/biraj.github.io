This research focuses on isolating linguistic regularities from dense word embeddings and further aggregating them as word vectors. The main intuition behind this work is to enable distributed and step-wise learning by isolating various regularities learned by the language model. The work aims to use isolated regularities to evaluate and understand various instances of human biases replicated by the language model.
