permalink: files/Syntactic_Representations_f.pdf
excerpt: 'This research focuses on making dense word embeddings interpretable via the means of metarepresentations - Syntactic Representations. The Syntactic Representations are eight dimensional vectors representing the eight respective parts of speech: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction and interjection. The Syntactic Representations further enable Hierarchical vectors which emulate the hierarchical aspect of human learning. The Hierarchical Vectors outperform pretrained vectors significantly in multiple tasks and the Syntactic Representations are visually interpretable, providing a view of the word through the eyes of the language model.'
