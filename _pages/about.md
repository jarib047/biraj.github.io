Hello!!

I am a PhD applicant for the 2025 Fall academic session. I received my M.Sc.Eng. and B.Eng. from Tribhuwan University. My primary areas of interest are representation engineering and interpretability with a focus on how changes in representation affects the model's biasness, faithfullness and performance.

My previous research works have been focused on interpreting non-contextual word embeddings by grounding them in syntactic embeddings aligned with part-of-speech dimensions to explore their linguistic properties and enhance their interpretability. I am currently working on extending this research to contextual embeddings, with the intention of splitting the embedding into a static base embedding and a dynamic context representation grounded in the aforementioned syntactic embedding. Furthermore, I am working on extending the work on Representation EDiting (RED) by isolating and identifying specific layers of LLM to help make the fine-tuning process less resource-intensive.
